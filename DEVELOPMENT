Week 1: Finished team contract and goal. Assigned work to each member. 

Week 2: Starting graph implentation and data reading --Bohan Liu
        Starting traversal implementation --Grace Chang
		Completed a working (but untested) graph implementation. With weight assignment left todo. --Bohan Liu
			The data is read, cleaned, and weighted according to the latitude and longitude is assigned to the dat file --Ming Wang
			The weight of the path(Weight of graph edges) is stored in the weight of the route. (Beta, for test usage.)   --Ming Wang
			Completed function: input the latitude and longitude coordinates of two airports, 
			and output a line connecting the two airports. --Ming Wang
			So the next task is to use the shortest path algorithm to find the points passing between airports. --Ming Wang
Week 3:
	Continue working on BFS generic functions -- Grace Chang
	Revised weight function by a integrating stops, airspeed and improve performance. --Bohan Liu
	```make test``` is now working. Created a basic made-up test data. --Bohan Liu
	LandmarkPath is implemented. --MingWang
	An Dijkstra.h file has been added for LandmarkPath's invoke. --Ming Wang
	This will be overwritten by a formal version uploaded by the assigned teammate. --Ming Wang
