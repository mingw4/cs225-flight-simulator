Week 1: Finished team contract and goal. Assigned work to each member. 

Week 2: Starting graph implentation and data reading --Bohan Liu
        Starting traversal implementation --Grace Chang
		Completed a working (but untested) graph implementation. With weight assignment left todo. --Bohan Liu
			The data is read, cleaned, and weighted according to the latitude and longitude is assigned to the dat file --Ming Wang
			The weight of the path(Weight of graph edges) is stored in the weight of the route.   --Wang
			Completed function: input the latitude and longitude coordinates of two airports, 
			and output a line connecting the two airports. --Ming Wang
			So the next task is to use the shortest path algorithm to find the points passing between airports, 
			and then use the line drawing function in pngtest.cpp 
			to draw the route on the standard airport latitude and longitude map.  --Ming Wang
