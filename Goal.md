CS 225 Project Goals 

We will be using the data from the Open Flight dataset for this project. The program will read the data from Open Flight and users' inputs for the desired starting point and destination. Once the information (the starting location and the desired destination) is given, the program will search for the best sequence of flights that lead them to the destination based on the shortest path. The additional landmark feature is to find the best path getting from location A to location B while passing location C.

We will love to add an additional feature producing graphical output for visualization if time is allowed.

We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal for algoritm development. To find the shortest path, we will implement Dijkstra's Algorithm with the airport and flight data. The landmark path algorithm will help us find the path from location A to location B while passing through location C. 

- Traversals
  1. Breadth First Search (required)
  
	  This part is used to help the algorithm development.
- Covered Algorithms
  1. Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (required)
  
	  This part is used to find the shortest path based on the airport and flight data.
- Complex or Uncovered Options
  1. Landmark Path (required)
  
    To find the shortest path a-b through c.
    This part is used to implement the landmark feature.
    
  2. Graphical output on projected onto a world map (optional)
  
    This part is about visual output.
