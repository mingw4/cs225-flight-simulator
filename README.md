CS 225 Project Goals 
In the final project, we will use the data set of the Open Flight dataset. We will build a program that reads in the dataset. Reads user input of different locations and yields the sequence of flights that lead them to the destination. A landmark feature is added. Also, we plan to make a visualization of the map and path, but not quite decided. 
- Traversals
  1. BFS (Breadth First Search)
	  This part is used to help the algorithm development.
- Covered Algorithms
  1. Shortest Path
  2. Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
  3. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
	  This part is used to find the shortest path based on the airport and flight data.
- Complex or Uncovered Options
  1. Landmark Path (shortest path a-b through c)
    This part is the base of the landmark feature.
  2. Graphical output on projected onto a world map
    This part is about visual output.
